 - Fork the Repository & Create a Pull Request (PR):
    If you want to add new programs, correct errors, or improve the existing notes, the best way is to fork the GitHub repository, make your changes, and open a pull request. This allows your contributions to be reviewed and merged directly into the project.

 - Create an Issue on GitHub:
    Spotted a mistake or have a suggestion? You can open an issue on the GitHub repository and describe what changes or additions you'd like to see. Be as clear and specific as possible — this helps in faster implementation.

 - Connect via Discord:
    If you prefer to discuss your ideas directly or need help with contributing, feel free to reach out to the project maintainer on Discord. Whether it’s a small fix or a large addition, your help is appreciated!\
