# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## What is DSA?

Data Structures and Algorithms is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems `effectively`. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.
